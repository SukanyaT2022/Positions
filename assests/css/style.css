1. RENAME THE PROJECT FOLDER TO "lastName-firstName-week-5-file-paths"
2. Inspect this project folder and all of the files and folders within it.
3. Add a background-image property to the six declaration blocks below.

**** Additional Help ****
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image
The background-image for the declaration block with the css selector of, ".one" will be "1.png" which is located in the images-1 folder in the assets folder. See step 2 to determine the location for the rest of the images.
The background-image for the declaration block with the css selector of, ".two" will be "2.png"
The background-image for ".three" will be "3.png" and so on.

This file (style.css) is in the ROOTFOLDER/assets/css folder.
The ROOTFOLDER is the lastName-firstname-week-5-file-paths folder.
To get back to the ROOTFOLDER you will need to go up two "folder levels".
The text "../../" without the quotes will let you go one level up into the assets folder.
The text "../../" without the quotes will let you go two levels up into the lastName-firstname-week-5-file-paths folder.
